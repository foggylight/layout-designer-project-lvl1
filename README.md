This is a simple landing page based on the materials of the article [Cognitive Biases in Programming](https://medium.com/hackernoon/cognitive-biases-in-programming-5e937707c27b).

In this project I organized the code according to the **OOCSS** methodology: components are **modular** and **classes can be reused**. I practiced my skills in the basics of layout and content **positioning**, main blocks are built by using **flexbox**. Tests and linter status is on badges above.

This project is a part of [Layout Designer](https://ru.hexlet.io/professions/layout-designer) course by [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/).
